# TapTrend

I have created a TapTrend app using Flutter. It has implement Near-field communication(NFC) is a wireless technology that allows devices to exchange data over short distances. NFC is used in a variety of applications, such as contactless payments, mobile wallets, and access control systems.

# Introduction of NFC in Flutter

NFC peer-to-peer data transfer is a great way to quickly and easily share data between two devices. It is especially useful for sharing small amounts of data, such as contact information or a link to a website.

To implement NFC peer-to-peer data transfer in Flutter, you will need to use the nfc_manager package. This package provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for interacting with NFC devices.

The nfc_manager package does not support peer-to-peer file transfer. This means that if you want to share a photo or other data from one device to another using NFC, you will need to use an NFC tag. This can be a major inconvenience, especially if you want to share data quickly and easily.

There are a few ways to work around the lack of peer-to-peer file transfer support in the nfc_manager package. One way is to use an NFC tag to act as a bridge between the two devices. NFC tags are small, disposable devices that can store a small amount of data. Most NFC tags have a storage limit of 512 KB. This means that you can only use NFC tags to transfer small files, such as photos or contact cards.

If you need to transfer a larger file, such as a video or audio file, you will need to use a different method, such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Letâ€™s explore the process of transferring peer-to-peer data using the NFC_manager package.
